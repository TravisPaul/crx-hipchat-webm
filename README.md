# crx-hipchat-webm
By default HipChat doesn't embed WEMBs uploaded in chat as it does for GIFs, JPEGs, and PNGs.  This extension simply embeds the video directly into the chat.

I will upload this to the Chrome Web Store when I confirm that it doesn't violate HipChat's Terms of Service. Util then, you can simply install as an unpacked extension.
