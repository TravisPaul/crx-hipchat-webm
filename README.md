By default HipChat doesn't embed WEMBs uploaded in chat as it does for GIFs, JPEGs, and PNGs.  This extension simply embeds the video directly into the chat.

I will upload this to the Chrome Web Store when I confirm that it doesn't violate HipChat's Terms of Service. Until then, you can simply [install as an unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).
